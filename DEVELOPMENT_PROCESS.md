# Development Process Documentation

## AI Tools Utilization

During the development of this project, I leveraged several AI tools to accelerate the coding process:

1. **GitHub Copilot**:
   - Used for boilerplate code generation (React components, TypeScript interfaces)
   - Suggested implementation patterns for Zustand state management
   - Generated Tailwind CSS utility classes based on component descriptions

2. **ChatGPT-5**:
   - Assisted in designing the architecture for real-time updates
   - Provided implementation strategies for conflict-free reservations
   - Suggested optimal data structures for table management

3. **Tabnine**:
   - Autocompleted complex TypeScript type definitions
   - Suggested context-aware React hooks implementations
   - Completed repetitive code patterns (e.g., form handlers)

## Areas Where AI Provided Most Value

1. **State Management Setup**:
   - AI suggested the Zustand architecture with actions and selectors
   - Reduced implementation time from ~2 hours to 30 minutes

2. **Real-time Simulation**:
   - AI provided the pattern for mock SSE implementation
   - Saved ~1.5 hours of research and implementation

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - AI generated Recharts configuration for peak hours visualization
   - Saved 45 minutes of chart configuration time

## Estimated Time Savings

| Task                | Manual Estimate  | With AI           | Saved Time            |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Architecture Design | 90 min           | 30 min            | 60 min                |
| State Management    | 120 min          | 40 min            | 80 min                |
| UI Components       | 180 min          | 60 min            | 120 min               |
| Analytics Dashboard | 90 min           | 30 min            | 60 min                |
| Form Implementation | 120 min          | 45 min            | 75 min                |
| **Total**           | 600 min (10 hrs) | 205 min (3.4 hrs) | **395 min (6.6 hrs)** |
